# MIPS Assembly Simulator

## Introduction
- This MIPS Assembly Simulator provides users with an intuitive platform to write, convert, and execute MIPS assembly language instructions. Designed as an educational tool, the simulator bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application by allowing step-by-step execution of machine code. By providing real-time visualization of register and memory states, this simulator facilitates a deeper comprehension of how MIPS instructions manipulate data and control program flow. The project combines a clean, user-friendly interface with robust backend functionalities, offering an engaging experience for learners and professionals alike.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser that supports JavaScript (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Setup and Run
1. Open the HTML file (`Assignment1.html`) in a browser.
2. Enter your assembly code in the provided textbox.
3. Click the **Assemble** button to translate the code into machine language.
4. Use additional controls for simulation:
   - **Step**: Execute instructions one by one.
   - **Run**: Execute the entire program.
   - **Memory Dump**: View memory content.
   - **Output Trace**: Log the memory addresses accessed during execution.
   - **Machine Code**: Get binary machine code of given input.

## Features
- Converts MIPS assembly code to machine code (binary).
- Simulates instruction execution with register and memory visualization.
- Supports instruction stepping, breakpoints, and tracing for debugging.

## Project Highlights
- **RISC Focus:** Simulates core MIPS functionalities for educational purposes.
- **Web-Based:** No external software required; runs entirely in the browser.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes controls for various simulation tasks and error handling.

## Known Limitations
- Supports a subset of MIPS instructions.
- May encounter performance issues with very large programs.
- Input size for assembly code is limited due to interface constraints.
