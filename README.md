# MIPS Assembly Simulator

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser that supports JavaScript (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Setup and Run
1. Open the HTML file (`Assignment1.html`) in a browser.
2. Enter your assembly code in the provided textbox.
3. Click the **Assemble** button to translate the code into machine language.
4. Use additional controls for simulation:
   - **Step**: Execute instructions one by one.
   - **Run**: Execute the entire program.
   - **Memory Dump**: View memory content.
   - **Output Trace**: Log the memory addresses accessed during execution.
   - **Machine Code**: Get binary machine code of given input.

## Features
- Converts MIPS assembly code to machine code (binary).
- Simulates instruction execution with register and memory visualization.
- Supports instruction stepping, breakpoints, and tracing for debugging.

## Project Highlights
- **RISC Focus:** Simulates core MIPS functionalities for educational purposes.
- **Web-Based:** No external software required; runs entirely in the browser.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes controls for various simulation tasks and error handling.

## Known Limitations
- Supports a subset of MIPS instructions.
- May encounter performance issues with very large programs.
- Input size for assembly code is limited due to interface constraints.
